## Allowed domains

1. imagejam.app for API interaction

3. clientside upload of images

# Prepare widget information

Like plugins, every widget will have its own page in the Figma Community. This allows other members of the Community to find and install your widget.

You'll need to provide some information for your widget listing. We recommend getting this set up before you start the publishing process.

## Choose a name for your widget. This can be something descriptive or a little creative. Users can search for your widget using this name, but you also have tags to add relevant keywords.

# Write a tagline to describe what your widget does in a few words. Taglines are used to determine search results when searching resources in the Community. Taglines also appear in browsing and search results instead of the description. Max 50 characters per tagline.

- Add visual exploration to your jambot sessions

# Create an icon to represent your widget in the Community and in files. The recommended dimensions are 128 x 128. If you upload a larger image, it will be scaled to fit as long as the icon has a 1:1 aspect ratio.

# Create some cover art for the top of your widget page. The recommended dimensions are 1920 x 960 (safe area: 1600 x 960). If you upload a larger image, it will be scaled to fit as long as the icon has a 2:1 aspect ratio.

# Include a playground file, if available. Playground files provide context on how to use your widget. This can be especially useful for widgets that are meant to be used over specific layers. Learn more about playground files →

## Write a description of your widget. Use this field to explain what the widget does, how to use it, and a sales pitch. If your widget requires a subscription, we recommended mentioning this first. You can format your description using some basic text formatting.

- Generating images should be explorative and not modify your assets.
- Exploration for images should work similarly to jambot where the inputs and outputs are persisted on canvas. Leaving it all on the canvas encourages new ideas by remixing branches

- Add variations to your moodboard
- Visualize your sticky
- Does not replace your existing sticky or image

## Add up to 12 keywords or tags to classify your widget. We support alphanumeric characters (a-z and 1-9), but no special characters or punctuation. Max 25 characters per tag.

1. image
2. generate
3. exploration

## As a widget creator, it's your responsibility to provide support for your widgets. You'll need to provide an email address, website, or help center for your support contact.

## Widget creators and contributors need their own Community Profile to be listed on the widget listing.

Effortless Image and Caption Generation

Inspired by Jambot, Image Jam uses stickies and images on canvas so you can focus in one view and keep track of your exploration.

Use Cases

Generate image with text: Create an image by connecting a sticky to Image Jam as a text prompt. Since it's a widget, you can reuse any stickies, including those generated from Jambot to jumpstart your session.
Generate caption: Write a description for an image by connecting an image to Image Jam. The output is a sticky upon which you can feed to a Jambot or iterate for the next image prompt.
Refine image: Iterate on an image by connecting a sticky and an image to Image Jam. This is useful for iterating on images and keeping track of their changes along the way.
