4. Different Filters to view a video

# Data flow

- User uploads video
  - Client uploads to S3
    - Lambda on frame count

# Market research

- An existing app is V1 Golf, which sucks because you have to login before seeing anything. There's definitely marketing opportunities for free-access tools https://apps.apple.com/us/app/v1-golf-golf-swing-analyzer/id349715369
- Swingbot.com also is a login only site https://swingbot.com/video

- What does the viewing experience offer better than that of YouTube? It doesn't.
